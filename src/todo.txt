TODO:


- test single lap

- make a smooth displacement field funciton in julia
  - can use Augmentor

- add base 6 to single lap

- the problem with repl speed is using ImageView -> find alternative to viewing images in julia





The way to use revise:
startup jl as is, then using LAP_julia. DONE
and call lap like this: "u_est, coeffs = LAP_julia.lap.single_lap(chess_norm_f, chess_warp_f, 3, 15, [15, 15])"
