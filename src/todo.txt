- make a smooth displacement field funciton in julia
  - can use Augmentor

- add base 6 to single lap
- debug this part:    dont use estimations whose displacement is larger than the filter_half_size
- the problem with repl speed is using ImageView -> find alternative to viewing images in julia





The way to use revise:
startup jl as is, then using LAP_julia. DONE
